These icons are for rating items. 

They are similar to Amazon's stars for 1-to-5 star book ratings, 
Netflix's stars for movie ratings, and many other sites' icons.

The icons have long descriptive names.

If you're using these for events, such as JavaScript mouse events,
then here's a typical mapping:

  * selected = star-with-orange-edge-and-yellow-fill.gif
  * unselected = star-with-orange-edge-and-white-fill.gif
  * disabled = star-with-gray-border-and-gray-fill.gif
  * hover = star-with-orange-edge-and-orange-fill.gif
  * press = star-with-orange-edge-and-orange-fill-and-yellow-highlight.gif
